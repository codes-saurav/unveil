PROJECT : UNVEIL 


BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT :
An innovative disruption empowering women and the transgender community. Due to the stigma associated with menstruation and the shame it instills, in some cases, people fail to acknowledge their menstrual cycle. In addition to empathizing with all the women out there dealing with their periods, we want to include folks who do not identify as cisgender women but do experience periods. 
The Web Application helps menstruators manage their menstrual cycle and is intended to raise awareness about the trans community and Period Management. The application goes beyond just tracking periods. It's an accurate Menstrual Calendar, Ovulation app, and Fertility tracker. 
You can switch to the premium version to locate nearby pharmacies version in case of emergency, pink toilets for sanitary napkins, restrooms, and other services. There is also information about various menstrual health issues. Almost all of us feel blue when we're on our period, so there's a section dedicated to getting your spirits up with music which is an effective form of therapy to provide an outlet for emotion.
Let's UNVEIL all the myths, stop the stigma, talk openly about periods, and manage them.
